A man [asked HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22442454) for
ways to find work while homeless.


Comments like:

   - A startup founder advertising its own employment company

   - People criticizing the OP because he said that he is squatting
     someone else property

   - People telling him that he should do more volunteer work and Open
   Source projects

Are we actually bad people or just stupid people living in a bubble of
well paid ignorance?
