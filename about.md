My name is **Pablo Gonz√°lez Carrizo** and I **do things** ‚úÖ.

As I don't trust my own memory, after doing things I log them here. So
this web is some kind of **personal brain dump** üß†. I could keep some
of this information private, but it would be selfish as most of my
knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts public (See
[**RMS**](https://stallman.org/), [**PG**](http://www.paulgraham.com/)
or [**Sacha Chua**](https://sachachua.com/blog/)).

üêí You may be be interested about why [**un mono que
teclea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)
(*typing monkey* in English).

Theose things I do include making **music**, **reading**,
**writting**, **programming** and **[torturing data until they
confess](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough,_it_will_confess_to_anything)**
üìà. By the way, my **[CV](../assests/CV.pdf)** says I have a **[MSc Degree
in Telecommunications
Engineering](http://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUITEL/index-en.html)**
and I have been **working with data**, and more precisely, in
**[democratizing Machine Learning](https://bigml.com/)** ü§ñ, last few
years.

You may have seen that I mix Spanish (my native language) and English
here. If you are *very* interested on one of my
[**articles**](../#blog) or [**thoughts**](../notes) and you want me
to translate it, write to me and I will try to do it.
