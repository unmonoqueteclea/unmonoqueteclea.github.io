Today, I decided to *open-source* [[https://voilib.com][Voilib]] ðŸŽ‰, the podcast search engine I
launched in December 2022. You can now *run your own instance* of it and
transcribe and index your favorite podcasts (or even your own
content!).You can find it on [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Github]] or [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Gitlab]].

Appearing in [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34115618][Show
HN]] was a big boost for the project. That post was the main source of
traffic during the first days of life of [[https://voilib.com][Voilib]]. I am thrilled to see
that many of those initial users still use it today to discover
relevant podcast episodes on topics they are interested in. Throughout
these months, I have received valuable feedback and kind words from
some of them.

Since I am not offering =Voilib PRO= any more (I may talk about this in
the future) the only funding for this project, to at least cover
server expenses, will come from [[https://ko-fi.com/unmonoqueteclea][donations]] and [[https://ko-fi.com/unmonoqueteclea/commissions][customized assistance]] to
people maintaining their own instances.

In the following weeks (well... maybe months), I will publish some
blog posts explaining how the system works. I consider this is the
kind of content I would have loved to find some months ago when many
people suddenly became =prompt engineers=, but not so many people really
understood how to build actual LLM-based products beyond the chat
interface.

*UPDATE* [2023-08-04] Read [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/2023-08-03-the-technology-behind-voilib.html][here]] about the technology behind *Voilib*.
