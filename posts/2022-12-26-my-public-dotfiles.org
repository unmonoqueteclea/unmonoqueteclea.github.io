*tldr* My dotfiles are now public [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles][on Gitlab]] ðŸŽ‰

Publishing one's *dotfiles* can feel like posting naked pictures. It may
show things that people wouldn't like to see. But I was finally brave
to do it (publishing dotfiles). I think it's fair to publish them, as
I have read many public dotfile repositories before writing mine. You
can find my dotfiles [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles][on Gitlab]].


* GNU stow
To keep a repository with all the dotfiles I am using =GNU Stow=. On its
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][website]], =GNU Stow= is defined as a *symlink farm manager*. It helps me to
manage automatically symlinks between =$HOME= (or any other place that
can contain dotfiles) and my dotfiles repository. I included a
[[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles/-/blob/main/makefile][makefile]] in the repository to automatically create all the needed
links using this tool.

* emacs config
The biggest part of my dotfiles repository is my =Emacs= configuration
in [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles/-/tree/main/emacs/.emacs.d][emacs/.emacs.d]]. I have a modularized =Emacs= configuration, keeping
=.el= files for things like agenda, theming, keybindings, etc. I try to
add explanations for everything I add there, so I hope they can be
useful to you.

* secrets
There are always private things in your dotfiles that you don't want
to show.

For instance, in [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles/-/tree/main/ssh/.ssh][ssh configuration]], there are some entries that I want
to keep secret. The solution was easy, I just need to add a new
=config.secret= file with those entries. That file will be included in
my =.gitignore= file and, to ensure I can access those entries, I added
the following to my main [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles/-/blob/main/ssh/.ssh/config][config file]]:

#+begin_src bash
Include config.secret
#+end_src

All your secret entries will be automatically imported!

I also keep some /gitignored/ =*.secrets.sh*= files that include *APIs keys*
and similar things.
