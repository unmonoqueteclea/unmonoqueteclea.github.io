[[https://valencianow.streamlit.app/][valencia-now]], a project that I announced a few days ago with great
reception on [[https://twitter.com/unmonoqueteclea/status/1769407185505644638][X]], is now public as of today üéâ.

This simple dashboard allows visualization of *real-time*, *historical*,
and *aggregated* data on *traffic* and *air quality* in Valencia.

* real-time information

The [[https://valencia.opendatasoft.com][open data portal]] of the Spanish city of Valencia provides
*real-time traffic data* for both [[https://valencia.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/punts-mesura-trafic-espires-electromagnetiques-puntos-medida-trafico-espiras-ele/][cars (and other motor vehicles)]] and
[[https://valencia.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/punts-mesura-bicis-espires-electromagnetiques-puntos-medida-bicis-espiras-electr/table/][bicycles]]. A series of electromagnetic loops distributed throughout the
city are capable of measuring the *intensity of vehicles* passing through
them. This information is published on an =hourly basis= for motor
vehicles and approximately every =30 minutes= for bicycles. With that
information, [[https://valencianow.streamlit.app/][valencia-now]] is able to build these two maps representing
current traffic intensity:

The *bicycle traffic* is also represented in the same way, as well as
the *air quality* data obtained from various measurement stations
located in different parts of the city. In this case, we are
representing the air quality index, a value that can range from =1=
(=hazardous=) in color *purple* to =6= (=good=) in color *blue*.

* historical and aggregated data

If I were to stop at that point, I wouldn't be adding much additional
value to this data, since the open data portal itself already provides
some simple visualizations of the current state of traffic and air
quality.

However, [[https://valencianow.streamlit.app/][valencia-now]] is also *collecting and storing this information*
which allows me not only to see the current status but also the
*evolution*.

With that historical data, I am also able to provide aggregations such
as the following one that shows how the *air quality in the city centre
improved just a day after the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_Fallas][Fallas]] finished*.

* next steps

In the following days, I would like to create some additional
blogposts.  I want to explain technical details about the *data
ingestion* and the *data transformation* processes (=spoiler=, [[https://www.tinybird.co/][tinybird]]
made this extremly simple) and also about *public open data
iniciatives*.

At some point in time I would like to make the collected data
available for everyone, but this will require some work.

üó®Ô∏è As always, feel free to contact me (=unmonoqueteclea@gmail.com=) for
whatever doubt, suggestion or idea you may have. Happy to receive your
feedback!
