Does it sounds familiar to you too?

* is this the future?
LLMs are beginning to change the process of *content generation* but
also *content consumption*, giving rise to some rather paradoxical
scenarios like the one I described.

- When it comes to *content generation*, humans contribute valuable
  information (=signal=), while LLMs (usually) decorate it with some
  irrelevant elements, effectively adding =noise=.

- During *content consumption*, humans trust LLMs to effectively
  distinguish and eliminate =noise= from the essential information.

A fascinating *feedback loop* appears in this new paradigm, wherein
efforts are made to enhance the intelligence of LLMs by using text
sourced from the Internet, which in some cases might have been
generated by other LLMs (making the signal to noise ratio lower on
each iteration).

I'm intrigued by the future of Language Models and the potential
revolutionary applications they might enable but I wonder whether
we'll see a resurgence of encyclopedias as the primary source of
reliable information with a *high signal to noise ratio*.
