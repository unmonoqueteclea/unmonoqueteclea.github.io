[[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/jira.el][jira.el]] is an =Emacs= package that brings the "power" of Atlassian's
=Jira= right into your editor. It lets you list, filter, and inspect
issues, modify properties, and even add worklogs‚Äîall without leaving
Emacs.

#+end_example

   your team) and apply custom JQL filters.
 - *Issue Details*: Open and inspect detailed information about any Jira
   issue.
 - *Modify Issues*: Update properties and add worklogs directly from
   your Emacs session.
 - *Tempo Integration*: Seamlessly display [[https://www.tempo.io/][Tempo]] worklogs to keep track
   of time spent on tasks.

=jira.el= combines a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tabulated-List-Mode.html][Tabulated List Mode]]-based UI, with [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]]-like
keyboard-driven menus, a combination loved by =Emacs= users.

Check out the =jira.el= documentation on =Github= for further details and
usage tips!
