Last week, a [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Voilib]] user reached out to me with two questions: how the project is
currently progressing, and whether I could recommend other AI-based tools that might
support his learning journey.

I’d like to share part of my reply here, since I believe it could be useful for others as
well:

I’m glad to hear Voilib was useful for you. I have to admit that keeping it updated isn’t
one of my main priorities these days. It’s a project that’s a bit too big to simply
self-host on a Raspberry Pi and check in on every few weeks. It’s harder to maintain when
the number of channels grows: the transcription process uses a lot of CPU, and the
embeddings database grows really quickly.  Still, building it end-to-end was a lot of fun
and a huge learning experience.

If I had to rebuild it today, I would try to simplify every component much more. For
example, using =sqlite-vec= could be a nice way to store embeddings without relying on an
additional service. And without any doubt, I’d make heavy use of [[https://simonwillison.net/][Simon Willison]]’s
excellent llm library (https://github.com/simonw/llm) as it handles embeddings, tool
calls, and supports any LLM provider. Both in a =CLI= and as a =Python= library.

In fact, that’s what I recommend to everyone: explore everything Simon has built on top of
that library. It’s impressive, and you can learn how agents really work without all the
unnecessary complexity others often add.  Write a =for= loop using tool calls and that
library and you will have built your own agent.

Good luck on your learning journey!

Best,
Pablo

And that's it. AI hype or AI winter, just start small (really small),
build things, and you’ll see what’s signal and what’s just noise.
