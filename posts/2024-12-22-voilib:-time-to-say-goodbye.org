The decision wasn’t easy, but maintaining a project like this without
funding is challenging. While models like Whisper have revolutionized
transcription, processing countless hours of audio remains a complex
task. Additionally, managing large collections of embeddings requires
fine-tuning the retrieval system—something I currently don’t have the
time to tackle.

That said, [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Voilib is Open Source]], so anyone can set up their own
instance with ease. I plan to release updates soon to simplify
installation and enhance its robustness. And, of course, the project
is open for external contributions.
