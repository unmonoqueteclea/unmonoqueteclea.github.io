  <description><![CDATA[
<p>
Today, I decided to <b>open-source</b> <a href="https://voilib.com">Voilib</a> ðŸŽ‰, the podcast search engine I
launched in December 2022. You can now <b>run your own instance</b> of it and
transcribe and index your favorite podcasts (or even your own
content!).You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib">Github</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib">Gitlab</a>.
</p>

<p>
Appearing in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34115618">Show
HN</a> was a big boost for the project. That post was the main source of
traffic during the first days of life of <a href="https://voilib.com">Voilib</a>. I am thrilled to see
that many of those initial users still use it today to discover
relevant podcast episodes on topics they are interested in. Throughout
these months, I have received valuable feedback and kind words from
some of them.

<p>
Since I am not offering <code>Voilib PRO</code> any more (I may talk about this in
the future) the only funding for this project, to at least cover
server expenses, will come from <a href="https://ko-fi.com/unmonoqueteclea">donations</a> and <a href="https://ko-fi.com/unmonoqueteclea/commissions">customized assistance</a> to
people maintaining their own instances.
</p>

<p>
In the following weeks (well&#x2026; maybe months), I will publish some
blog posts explaining how the system works. I consider this is the
kind of content I would have loved to find some months ago when many
people suddenly became <code>prompt engineers</code>, but not so many people really
understood how to build actual LLM-based products beyond the chat
interface.
