[This repository](https://github.com/marcpaq/b1fipl) contains many
examples of single-file implementations of programming languages.  I
love [this one from Peter Norvig](http://www.norvig.com/lispy.html).
He builds a semi-practical **Scheme interpreter in Python 3**.

As he says, the beauty of Scheme is that the full language only needs
5 keywords and 8 syntactic forms.
