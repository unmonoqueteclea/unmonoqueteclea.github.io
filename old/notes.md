This **microblogging** page contains my daily thoughts and findings as
well as interesting news I find everyday. This is something that I
could have in [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/unmonoqueteclea) or
[**Mastodon**](https://mastodon.social/@unmonoqueteclea) (actually, I
will try to automatically publish the same content there), but I want
to have *the control of my own content*. My URL, my rules üì£. Check
more [here](../2020/hello-world-again/#microblogging)

In this way, you can subscribe to my [**microblogging
 RSS**](../journal_feed.xml) üìÆ and read everything in beautiful ‚ù§
 plain text ‚ù§. You could even read it from
 [**emacs**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
 [**elfeed**](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed)!
