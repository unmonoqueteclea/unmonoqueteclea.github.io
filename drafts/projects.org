* ✅ jira.el: Emacs integration for Jira

#+begin_quote
If you have no choice but to use Jira, at least do it without leaving Emacs.
#+end_quote

[[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/jira.el][jira.el]] is an =Emacs= package that brings the "power" of Atlassian's
=Jira= right into your editor. It lets you list, filter, and inspect
issues, modify properties, and even add worklogs—all without leaving
Emacs.

[[https://stable.melpa.org/#/jira][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/jira-badge.svg]]

#+begin_example
ℹ️ Status <2026-01-22 Mon>: Jira is already part of MELPA! 🎉
#+end_example

Key Features:

 - *List & Filter Issues*: Quickly view the issues assigned to you (or
   your team) and apply custom JQL filters.
 - *Issue Details*: Open and inspect detailed information about any Jira
   issue.
 - *Modify Issues*: Update properties and add worklogs directly from
   your Emacs session.
 - *Tempo Integration*: Seamlessly display [[https://www.tempo.io/][Tempo]] worklogs to keep track
   of time spent on tasks.

=jira.el= combines a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tabulated-List-Mode.html][Tabulated List Mode]]-based UI, with [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]]-like
keyboard-driven menus, a combination loved by =Emacs= users.

Check out the =jira.el= documentation on =Github= for further details and
usage tips!


* 🦇 valencia-now: Real-time traffic information about Valencia
[[https://valencianow.unmonoqueteclea.freemyip.com/][valencia-now]] provides *real-time* information about *car and bike traffic*
in the city of *Valencia* (Spain). Additionally, it also provides *air
quality data*.

#+begin_example
ℹ️ Status <2026-01-22 jue>: After some downtime due to issues with data publication
from the city council, my real-time Valencia traffic visualization project is
back online 🚦. And now it includes new data about the location of active
V16 beacons 🚗✨
#+end_example

Induction loops installed in different parts of Valencia can measure
the number of *cars* and *bikes* passing through them. However, the City
Council only offers [[https://valencia.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/punts-mesura-trafic-espires-electromagnetiques-puntos-medida-trafico-espiras-ele/][the latest measurement]], not the historical
data. This limiation also applies to [[https://valencia.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/estacions-contaminacio-atmosferiques-estaciones-contaminacion-atmosfericas/table/][air quality data]].

With the help of [[https://www.tinybird.co/][Tynibird]], I am able to collect this data every hour
and present it through this dashboard. Users can view real-time
information on the *map* or access *historical* and *aggregated* data from
specific sensors.

* 🔈voilib.com: The open source search engine for audio content
I launched [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Voilib]] in December 2022 to allow people to do semantic
search within podcast transcriptions. Some months later, in July 2023,
I decided to [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][open-source]] it.

#+begin_example
ℹ️ Status: <2025-10-11 Sat>  Voilib permanently shut down on December 14th, 2024,
and its repository was archieved on October 11th 2025. As AI advances at a
blistering pace and the Python ecosystem evolves constantly, this project may
become outdated or less useful as a learning resource over time. Still, I believe
it retains archeological interest: it was created in the early days of RAG-style
systems, when the “best practices” for building on top of them were far from
settled. Use at your own risk, and feel free to fork it for experimentation
or study.
#+end_example

[[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Voilib]] offers semantic search in thousands of minutes of high-quality
transcriptions of podcasts. Just type your query in English 🇺🇸 or
Spanish 🇪🇸 and it will find related content in thousands of
episodes. Every day, [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Voilib]] automatically collects, transcribe and
index new episodes from a [[https://voilib.com/content][list of podcasts]]. [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][Self-hosted version of
Voilib]] is also able to index local audio files. For example, you can
feed it with recordings of all your online meetings and be able to
search for content within them.

You can read this [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/2023-08-03-the-technology-behind-voilib.html][post]] about the technology behind it.

* 👁️ Retis: Diabetic Retinopathy and DMAE detection

=Retis= is a latin word and means *network*. This is because the retina is
a big network of blood vessels.

Retis is a tool to detect *Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)* and *Age-Related
Macular Degeneration (DMAE)* in eye fundus images using *Convolutional
Neural Networks* and *Activation Maps*. Try it [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/retis/][here]]

This project is my final *Master's Degree Thesis* in [[https://www.upv.es/en][Polytechnical
University of Valencia]]. You can download the thesis (in Spanish)
[[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/retis/raw/master/thesis.pdf][here]].

* ⚙ My public dotfiles and emacs configuration
My =dotfiles= and my =Emacs= configuration are public [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles][on Gitlab]].  I always
try to keep them updated. Some information in this [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/2022-12-26-my-public-dotfiles.html][post]].
