* üîàvoilib.com: the open source search engine for audio content
I launched [[https://voilib.com][voilib.com]] in December 2022 to allow people to do semantic
search within podcast transcriptions. Some months later, in July 2023,
I decided to [[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/voilib][open-source]] it.

[[https://voilib.com][Voilib]] offers semantic search in thousands of minutes of high-quality
transcriptions of podcasts. Just type your query in English üá∫üá∏ or
Spanish üá™üá∏ and it will find related content in thousands of
episodes. Every day, [[https://voilib.com][Voilib]] automatically collects, transcribe and
index new episodes from a [[https://voilib.com/content][list of podcasts]].

You can read this [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/2023-08-03-the-technology-behind-voilib.html][post]] about the technology behind it.

* üëÅÔ∏è retis: Diabetic Retinopathy and DMAE detection

=retis= is a latin word and means *network*. This is because the retina is
a big network of blood vessels.

Retis is a tool to detect *Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)* and *Age-Related
Macular Degeneration (DMAE)* in eye fundus images using *Convolutional
Neural Networks* and *Activation Maps*. Try it [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/retis/][here]]

This project is my final *Master's Degree Thesis* in [[https://www.upv.es/en][Polytechnical
University of Valencia]]. You can download the thesis (in Spanish)
[[https://github.com/unmonoqueteclea/retis/raw/master/thesis.pdf][here]].

* ‚öô my public dotfiles and emacs configuration
My =dotfiles= and my =emacs= configuration are public [[https://gitlab.com/unmonoqueteclea/dotfiles][on Gitlab]].  I always
try to keep them updated. Some information in this [[https://unmonoqueteclea.github.io/2022-12-26-my-public-dotfiles.html][post]].
