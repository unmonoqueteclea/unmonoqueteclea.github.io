🐒 Why =unmonoqueteclea?= It means *typing monkey* (in Spanish).
And [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem][this Wikipedia entry]] will help you understand it. Although you will find
me everywhere as =unmonoqueteclea=, my name is *Pablo González Carrizo*.

Most of my knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts
and code public (some of my favorites are  [[https://stallman.org][RMS]], [[http://www.paulgraham.com/][PG]], [[https://sachachua.com/blog/][Sacha Chua]] or
[[https://protesilaos.com/][Prot]]). I am morally obliged to do my bit.

* work
My CV says I have a =MSc Degree in Telecommunications Engineering=. For
the last few years, I have been working as a =Full-Stack Engineer=, trying to
*democratize Machine Learning* 🤖 at [[https://bigml.com][BigML]].

I consider myself an =end-to-end programmer=, the kind of programmer
that can build a working prototype of a product in a few nights.

You can also check my 👨‍💻 [[./static/cv.pdf][CV]] and my 🏆 [[./awards.html][awards]].
