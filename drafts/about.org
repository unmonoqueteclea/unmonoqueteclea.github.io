üêí Why =unmonoqueteclea?= It means *typing monkey* (in Spanish).
And [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem][this Wikipedia entry]] will help you understand it. Although you will find
me everywhere as =unmonoqueteclea=, my name is *Pablo Gonz√°lez Carrizo*.

Most of my knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts
and code public (some of my favorites are  [[https://stallman.org][RMS]], [[http://www.paulgraham.com/][PG]], [[https://sachachua.com/blog/][Sacha Chua]] or
[[https://protesilaos.com/][Prot]]). I am morally obliged to do my bit.

* work
My CV says I have a =MSc Degree in Telecommunications Engineering=. For
the last few years, I have been working with data, trying to
*democratize Machine Learning* ü§ñ at [[https://bigml.com][BigML]]. I consider myself an
=end-to-end programmer=, the kind of programmer that (without being an
expert in =front-end=, =back-end= or =dev ops=) can build a working
prototype of a product in a few nights.
