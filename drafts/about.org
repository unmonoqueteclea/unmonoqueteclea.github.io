* unmonoqueteclea
üêí Why =unmonoqueteclea?= It means *typing monkey* (in Spanish).
And [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem][this Wikipedia entry]] will help you understand it. Although you will find
me everywhere as =unmonoqueteclea=, my name is *Pablo Gonz√°lez Carrizo*.

Most of my knowledge comes from other people that made her thoughts or
code public (some of my favorites are [[https://stallman.org][RMS]], [[http://www.paulgraham.com/][PG]], or [[https://protesilaos.com/][Prot]]). I am morally
obliged to do my bit.


* work
My CV says I have a =MSc Degree in Telecommunications Engineering=. For
the last few years, I have been working as a =Full-Stack Engineer=, trying to
*democratize Machine Learning* ü§ñ at [[https://bigml.com][BigML]].

I consider myself an *end-to-end engineer*, the kind of person that can
transform ideas into working prototypes in a few nights fueled with
some cups of tea.

You can also check my CV ([[./static/cv.pdf][PDF]], [[./static/cv.html][HTML]], [[./static/cv.txt][plain text FTW!]]) and my [[./awards.html][awards]]  üèÜ.
