<b>tldr</b>: I moved the blog to an extremly simple static blog generator
with no dependencies, no <code>Javascript</code> and no magic tricks. Just plain
<code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you have been following this blog for some time you will have
noticed that I am not very good at keeping a routine of writing new
blog posts every week (or even every month). But there was something
that created more friction in the writing process (even more than the
white paper syndrome): every time I wanted to add new content, usually
after some months with no content, the blog build process was
broken. I spent more time fixing the blog that adding content to
it. This made me move to lightweight blogging systems like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. But
it wasn't enough so I decided to embrace minmimalism.
</p>

<p>
What is the very minimal list of features that I need in a blogging
framework?:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Convert from markup languages such as <code>markdown</code> or <code>org-mode</code> into
plain <code>html</code></li>
<li>Keep an updated <b>index</b> page</li>
<li>Automatically create a <code>rss.xml</code> file</li>
<li>Automatically create an <b>archive</b> page and, ideally, another page for
each <b>tag</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
Just that. Those are the only things that I really need. And that is
what <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">org-static-blog</a> gives me. One single dependency, integrated into
Emacs, my <del>OS</del> (well&#x2026; my editor). No <code>Javascript</code>, just pure <code>HTML5</code> and
<code>CSS3</code>.
